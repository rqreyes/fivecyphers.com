          <p>In the Water Book, I discuss the more intangible things surrounding bboying/bgirling. This section makes up the core of my Heiho and must be fully understood. Although the concepts are difficult and I may have left things out, with a genuine attitude and willingness to learn, the truth should become self-evident.</p>

          <h4>On The "Flowing Water Blow"</h4>
          <p>The "Flowing Water Blow" is an attack that you can utilize when your opponent attacks at a single tempo. The point here is to demonstrate that you have a higher level of control than the person you’re battling. If your opponent appears too energetic and out of control, come out slowly and toprock slowly on beat to demonstrate that you can move at multiple speeds.</p>
          <p>When the music changes appropriately, or you move to the floor, speed up your tempo to show your level of control. Doing this will not only draw attention to your ability to control yourself, but it will make your opponent look as if they were nervous and too hectic. The point of this move is to simulate a river or ocean in its different states of flowing. Consider a river that moves quickly in the rapids, but slows down to a crawl and is very calm in certain parts. Your dancing can model this flow.</p>

          <h4>Dancing to the Music</h4>
          <p>The music is one of (if not the) most important aspects of dancing. The music that you practice to, battle to, and even listen to in your off time will influence the way you dance.</p>
          <p>You must learn not only to dance on beat, but to interpret sounds in the songs you are dancing to. While Indian Steps may make sense for a typical snare, a drum roll could be rapid foot movement, a baseline could create upper body movement, a horn could be a slide or a spin, or a guitar riff could be rapid hand movements. Don’t stop your flow but maintain the rhythm of the song.</p>
