          <p>The Fire Book is a discussion of battles. My goal here is to give you the tools to be successful in judged battles. The idea of the Fire Book is to give you the tools to understand battles and know how to conduct yourself with fidelity.</p>

          <h4>Control the Music</h4>
          <p>Strictly speaking, the DJ controls the music. Unless the DJ knows what you like to hear and is willing to give it to you, you are at the mercy of what the DJ likes to play. You can, however, control what part of a song you dance to and ultimately what part of a song you give to your opponent. This will come by knowing the songs that each DJ plays, and if they loop them or not—with this in mind, you can take the good part of a song for yourself, and leave your opponent stuck with a bad part of the song.</p>
          <p>The most obvious example of this is Kleju dancing to “Killing” by The Apples. While you may have seen this video before, pay attention to what happens after Kleju’s set in relation to the music:</p>

          <h4>Laying Traps</h4>
          <p>Another tactic that is often misused by bboys/bgirls is laying a trap at the end of your set—many bboys/bgirls will lay a trap at the end of their round by creating the appearance that they have finished, and when their opponent comes out to start their set, they will hit the floor again so as to try to throw off the opponent.</p>
          <p>You must do three things when laying a trap:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Throw your opponent off balance (by having them start to move).</li>
            <li>Do something with substance and do it fast. The formula of your trap is the same as a counter blow up. Only do one to three moves (or two to four with transitions) and have them hit hard.</li>
            <li>Execute. Your entire set will be called into question if you don’t execute your trap.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>One of the most effective traps I’ve seen was set by Napalm when he battled Victor at the BC North America Finals in 2015. Although he ultimately lost the battle, the trap he laid was strong and forced Victor to respond with some of his best material:</p>
