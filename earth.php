          <p>The purpose of the Earth Book is to give you a foundation to understand bboying/bgirling. This is about the more practical aspects of the dance, which includes the state of things as I see them at the moment, and ideas about how to practice, execute, and build your own style to obtain a greater understanding of dancing as a whole.</p>

          <h4>About Constructing Your Rounds and Sets</h4>
          <p>In this section I will show you how to build your rounds, what pieces you need to master, and how to practice them. You must then continue learning and practicing to take yourself to a higher level!</p>
          <p>Set construction or "packaging" is one of the most important things you must initially master when thinking about your bboying/ bgirling. By packaging your moves well, you can not only increase the effectiveness of the moves that you do use, but convince those around you that you are airtight.</p> 
          <p>Poe One taught me the idea of set construction and related it to a narrative—your go-down must be like a story: there is a coherent beginning, middle, and end. You shouldn’t have a beginning in the middle of your story, and likewise, the ending shouldn’t come first.</p> 
          <p>The below "Basic Set Formulas" may seem intuitive and you may already know them—now that you "know" them, however, learn to understand, recognize, and do them on purpose.</p>

          <h4>Basic Set Formulas</h4>
          <p><strong>Toprock-Footwork-Freeze</strong> – The most fundamental of the sets. By doing tops, footwork, and ending in a freeze, you’ll put together a complete set. This formula is difficult to beat, has the necessary pieces for a full set, and will look good.</p> 
          <p><strong>Toprock-Power-Footwork-Freeze</strong> – One of the hardest sets to beat because it has all the pieces. You’ll be surprised at how well you can do at a jam by using this formula—Issei from Foundnation won R-16 multiple times just by using this single method of constructing sets, and Victor from The Squadron/MF Kidz often employs this formula.</p> 
          <p><strong>Toprock-Footwork-Power-Freeze</strong> – This formula is similar to the above in that it has all the pieces and is hard to beat, but it tends to have a bit more texture because you’ll need to figure out different ways to get into power.</p>
          <p><strong>Toprock-Power-Freeze</strong> – The basic "powermover" formula. This is extremely effective in crew battles, but tends to be difficult to win in formats with fewer people (i.e. 1v1s, 2v2s). Be aware that if you use this, there are many judges that may mark you down because you didn’t do footwork and "that’s not bboying/bgirling" (or so they would say). If this formula speaks to you, I encourage you to push the limits and make it as effective as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Toprock-Freeze-Footwork-Freeze</strong> – A set with more "texture." While still relatively basic in terms of on-paper construction, this is a formula that can be hard to make flow. Play with this and learn how to incorporate different weapons in different parts of your dance.</p>

          <h4>Developing Texture</h4>
          <p>When I say texture, I refer to the different ways that you can move in a set. This encompasses level changing, slides, spins, moving both ways, jumping, vibrating, tempo changes—anything that will break up the monotony of a generic set. Consider a landscape—while a flat landscape with nothing but dirt is beautiful in its own right, think of how much more interesting a view is with texture, be it mountains, forest, or ocean.</p>
          <p><strong>Take Downs</strong> – You must first learn all the basic take downs and learn how to do them well. Once you’ve developed a strong vocabulary, develop unique take downs. These should have a focus on tempo, strength, explosiveness, or finesse.</p>
          <p><strong>Level Changes</strong> – Level changes are an excellent way to add diversity to your rounds. Moving up and down in power moves, doing level changes with your foot and floor works, and doing freezes on multiple levels adds visual diversity to what you are doing.</p>
          <p><strong>Jumps</strong> – Doing airborne moves is a very dynamic form of texture. Flips, powermoves in the air, and hops are one way of doing this, but consider simply doing a move you already know, and making it airborne.</p>
          <p><strong>Traveling Moves</strong> – Slides are a good way to travel across the floor, but consider that you can do any move as a traveling move. Powermoves, footwork, even freezes can travel. Take moves that you’ve already developed and figure out a way to move in different directions with them.</p>
          <p><strong>Moves Both Ways</strong> – It is important to learn to do moves both ways. I highly encourage you to learn your footwork and at least basic power and freezes on both sides. From there, be intentional about developing movement both ways in your sets. If you’re constantly rotating in one direction, you’ll begin to look monotonous.</p>
